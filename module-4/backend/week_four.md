## Week Four - Module 4 Recap

Fork this respository. Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Try to answer them with limited amount of external research. These questions cover the majority of what we've learned this week.

Note: When you're done, submit a PR.

1. What's your favorite project management tool?
* I like Waffle because of the GitHub integration.
2. Why do we create staging environments?
* So that we can deploy to something that acts just like production without actually deploying to production.
3. What are the characteristics of a good README (in your opinion)?
* What the project does, how to set up the project locally, list of any keys/passwords needed, how to contribute, who built it.
4. What's one main improvement you're going to make to your code regarding accessibility issues?
* Adding alt images.
5. What are some basic security concerns to be aware of when building applications?
* SQL injection, CSRF.
6. Why is continuous integration helpful/important?
* You can set up scripts to run whenever a branch is pushed. That means you can run things like at push, and if the tests fail prevent the branch from being merged.
7. What are some pros/cons of using ReactJS as a frontend tool?
* Pros: fast loads/changes, SRP is easy to implement, each component is modular.
* Cons: it can be a little complex.

#### Review  

8. What are some characteristics of "good" git workflow?
* Frequent commits, frequent PRs and merges, good code reviews, use of branches dedicated to a specific feature.
9. Describe each of the four fundamental concepts of object oriented programming.
* Encapsulation - keeping state/behavior encapsulated in only the areas of the code that need access to it.
* Polymorphism - A subclass can inherit from a parent class, which allows the reuse of behavior.
* Abstraction - Only exposing the necessary interface of an object to the app outside of itself.
* Inheritance - Related to polymorphism, a class can pass its behavior to another class. 
10. What's a module in Ruby? What's the difference between a class and a module? What are some good use cases for modules?
* Classes have state and behavior, modules only have behavior. Modules are great for reusing logic in multiple classes.
